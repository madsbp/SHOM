# SHOM
Linearized shallow water ocean model (SWOM) in a simple rectangular basin. The main purpose of the model is to become familiar with the type of waves that emerge in a rotating homogeneous fluid when the surface of the fluid is disturbed. In particular the model allows student to visualize and study gravity waves, Kelvin waves and Rossby waves.
